Administrator's Individual Locale
=================================

When employing a multilingual staff Magento gets in the way by forcing the default locale and language setting on every admin user who logs in.  Once logged out their choice is forgotten and they must manually set their language, again, every time they return.

This extension simply saves each user's language as they set it.  There are no new options to configure nor any permissions to set.
